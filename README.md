# alanturing
As a child, Alan Turing's work in cryptanalysis and the Turing Test inspired my curiosity about computing and AI. Creating Python implementations of Turing Machines, cryptanalysis, and historical simulations like Enigma and the Bombe. I aim to honor his genius and legacy and explore the foundations of modern computation.
